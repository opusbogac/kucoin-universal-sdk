Welcome to the **Node.js** implementation of the KuCoin Universal SDK. This SDK is built based on KuCoin API specifications to provide a comprehensive and optimized interface for interacting with the KuCoin platform.

For an overview of the project and SDKs in other languages, refer to the [Main README](https://github.com/kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk).

## 📦 Installation

### Latest Version: `0.1.0-alpha`
Note: This SDK is currently in the Alpha phase. We are actively iterating and improving its features, stability, and documentation. Feedback and contributions are highly encouraged to help us refine the SDK.

Install the SDK using `npm`:

```bash
npm install kucoin-universal-sdk
```

## 📖 Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you started with the SDK in **TypeScript**.

```ts
import {
    ClientOptionBuilder,
    DefaultClient,
    GlobalApiEndpoint,
    GlobalBrokerApiEndpoint,
    GlobalFuturesApiEndpoint,
    Spot,
    TransportOptionBuilder
} from 'kucoin-universal-sdk';

function example() {
    // Retrieve API secret information from environment variables
    const key = process.env.API_KEY || '';
    const secret = process.env.API_SECRET || '';
    const passphrase = process.env.API_PASSPHRASE || '';

    // Set specific options, others will fall back to default values
    const httpTransportOption = new TransportOptionBuilder()
        .setKeepAlive(true)
        .setMaxConnsPerHost(10)
        .setMaxIdleConns(10)
        .build();

    // Create a client using the specified options
    const clientOption = new ClientOptionBuilder()
        .setKey(key)
        .setSecret(secret)
        .setPassphrase(passphrase)
        .setSpotEndpoint(GlobalApiEndpoint)
        .setFuturesEndpoint(GlobalFuturesApiEndpoint)
        .setBrokerEndpoint(GlobalBrokerApiEndpoint)
        .setTransportOption(httpTransportOption)
        .build();

    const client = new DefaultClient(clientOption);

    // Get the Restful Service
    const kucoinRestService = client.restService();

    const spotMarketApi = kucoinRestService.getSpotService().getMarketApi();

    // Create request by interface
    let request = Spot.GetPartOrderBookReq.create({
        'symbol': 'BTC-USDT',
        'size': '20',
    })

    // Or create request by builder
    request = Spot.GetPartOrderBookReq.builder().setSize('20').setSymbol('BTC-USDT').build();

    // Query for part orderbook depth data. (aggregated by price)
    spotMarketApi.getPartOrderBook(request).then((result) => {
        console.log(`Time: ${result.time}, Seq: ${result.sequence}, Bids: ${result.bids}, Asks: ${result.asks}`);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error('fail to get part order book', err);
    })
}

## 📌 Special Notes on APIs

This section provides specific considerations and recommendations for using the REST and WebSocket APIs.

### REST API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Advanced HTTP Handling**:
    - Supports retries, persistent connections, and connection pooling for efficient request handling.
- **Extensible Interceptors**:
    - Provides HTTP interceptors that users can extend to customize request and response processing.
- **Rich Response Details**:
    - Includes rate-limiting information and raw response data in API responses for better debugging and control.
- **Public API Access**:
    - For public endpoints, API keys are not required, simplifying integration for non-authenticated use cases.

---

### WebSocket API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Flexible Service Creation**:
    - Supports creating services for public/private channels in Spot, Futures, or Margin trading as needed.
    - Multiple services can be created independently.
- **Service Lifecycle**:
    - If a service is closed, create a new service instead of reusing it to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Connection-to-Channel Mapping**:
    - Each WebSocket connection corresponds to a specific channel type. For example:
        - Spot public/private and Futures public/private services require 4 active WebSocket connections.

#### Threading and Callbacks
- **Simple Thread Model**:
    - WebSocket services follow a simple thread model, ensuring callbacks are handled on a single thread.
- **Subscription Management**:
    - Subscriptions are synchronous. A subscription is considered successful only after receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the server.
    - Each subscription has a unique ID, which can be used for unsubscribe.

#### Data and Message Handling
- **Framework-Managed Threads**:
    - Data messages are handled by a single framework-managed thread, ensuring orderly processing.
- **Buffer Management**:
    - When the message buffer is full, excess messages are dropped, and a notification event is sent.
- **Duplicate Subscriptions**:
    - Avoid overlapping subscription parameters. For example:
        - Subscribing to `["BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT"]` and then to `["ETH-USDT", "DOGE-USDT"]` may result in undefined behavior.
        - Identical subscriptions will raise an error for duplicate subscriptions.

## 📑 Parameter Descriptions

This section provides details about the configurable parameters for both HTTP and WebSocket client behavior.
